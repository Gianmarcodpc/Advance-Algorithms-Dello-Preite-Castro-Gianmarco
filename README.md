Tarjan's Algorithm is working as intended, the final output is stored in the 'tarjanComponentsCount' global variable.

Nuutila's Algorithm is working as intended, the final output is stored in the 'nuutilaComponentsCount' global variable.

Pearce's algorithm is NOT working as intended.

Further explanations will be given during the project presentation.
Any further code changes and/or commits are purely post-processing needed for the project presentation.
